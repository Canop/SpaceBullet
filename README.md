SpaceBullet
===========

SpaceBullet is an HTML5 game with many missions, available at https://dystroy.org/spacebullet/

There's a Miaou community page at https://miaou.dystroy.org/1260?SpaceBullet


## State of the project and code

The game is now old but works well and is played at https://dystroy.org/spacebullet with 30 missions forming a tutorial and a fine tuned progression (those missions are part of this repository).

The front-end part is OK and could be modified and compiled without problem in 2019.

The Go Backend isn't maintained anymore. It was dedicated to managing and hosting user submitted missions but it wasn't really used so I removed it. This part of the code might be removed in the future.

## Dev

### Try it after having downloaded it

Open in your browser the `src/dev.html` file.

### Build it

Use `make.sh` to build the minified production version.

### Licence

This is a TODO point. For now consider the game mine. But you can ping me on Miaou if you want this point solved.

### Contribution

Please come to Miaou and discuss before even trying to send a pull request.
